# Exercise: Spelling Bee Screenshots

This first exercise serves two roles: testing our Github Classroom set-up and getting you 
engaged with [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee), a pretty popular 
game from the New York Times. 

This exercise is pretty straightforward:

1. Accept the assignment
2. Clone the repository to your machine.
3. In the next week, play Spelling Bee on your computer or phone for about 10 minutes. Take a screenshot of your progress at that point. 
4. Save the screenshot images into your repository folder.
5. Commit them to the repo
6. Push the repo back into Github.

Ta-da!
